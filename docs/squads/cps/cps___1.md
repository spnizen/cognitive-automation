#   Cloud Pak Systems
##  Overview

IBM® Cloud Pak System is an integrated, highly-scalable system that is based on IBM X-Architecture, providing an application-centric computing model in a cloud environment.

An application-centric system is an efficient way to manage complex applications and the tasks and processes that are invoked by the application. The entire system implements a diverse virtual computing environment, in which different resource configurations are automatically tailored to different application workloads. The application management capabilities of the IBM Cloud Pak System platform make deployment of middleware and other application components quick, easy, and repeatable.

IBM Cloud Pak System provides virtualized workloads and scalable infrastructure that is delivered in one integrated system:
Virtualized system and application workloads, including:
Integrated middleware like IBM WebSphere® Application Server, web server, DB2®, and hypervisor images.
Elastic data.
Application-centric workloads created using pattern types such as web application patterns, database application patterns, and topology patterns.
Scalable infrastructure, including:
Optimized hardware tuned for running workloads.
Isolated networking for secure communications.
Server resiliency to prevent overload or failures.
Dynamic storage.
Integrated delivery, including:
Factory assembled and wired system.
Tuned for maximum efficiency of data, storage, workload execution, and retrievability.
Simple approach to managing all integrated components and monitoring health of the system.
Single pane of glass management for administrator and application deployment.
