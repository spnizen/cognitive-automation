## 1.1 Cisco ACI

Since its development in 2012, Cisco ACI has been the industry’s most secure, open, and comprehensive software-defined networking (SDN) solution. ACI enables automation that accelerates infrastructure deployment and governance, simplifies management to easily move workloads across a multifabric, hybrid cloud, or multicloud framework, and proactively secures against risk arising from anywhere.  It radically simplifies, optimizes, and expedites the application deployment lifecycle. Cisco ACI enables customers to build a truly agile and resilient data center with policies that can move anywhere through automation.

As application usage gets more pervasive across the enterprise network, IT professionals are looking to build solutions for consistent policy and encryption from the campus to the data center. For example, Cisco ACI integrations with Cisco Software-Defined Access (SD-Access) / Cisco DNA Center and Cisco SD-WAN allow customers to automate and extend policy, security, assurance, and insights across their entire networking ecosystem. With Cisco ACI, customers can manage complexity, maximize business benefits, and deploy workloads in any location, small and large, on premises and remote, in private and public clouds
