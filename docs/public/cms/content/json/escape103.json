      "description": "Firstly, a Service Reliability Engineer is primarily responsible for designing and implementing systems and processes to improve the reliability and scalability of a software or technology system. This includes monitoring and measuring key performance indicators (KPIs), setting up automated processes for fault detection and resolution, and continuously identifying and addressing potential risks and issues. The ultimate goal of an SRE is to reduce downtime and disruptions, and to improve the overall user experience of the system.",

This involves regularly monitoring and reporting on service availability, analyzing data to identify any downtimes or outages and working with the development and operations teams to implement solutions. A SAM is also responsible for conducting risk assessments and creating contingency plans to minimize interruptions to service.",
