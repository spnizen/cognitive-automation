???+ info "Monitoring and Events Management with ITM6 (Sunset Soon)"

    The IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM6) is configured in PIaaS and CoreIT devices to probe for various situations wherein the events/alerts triggered by these devices are captured by the MCMS NetCool Impact System which inturn then creates an Incident(s) in MCMS ServiceNow based on specific configuration setting(s) enabled on the NetCool. Though the events/alerts are captured but the Auto-Remediation correction using the Ansible Playbooks is not enabled or configured yet due to the disconnect in flow between MCMS NetCool Impact and CACF NEXT.

     In M&EaaS the IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM6) will be replaced with ScienceLogic SaaS tool configured for a PIaaS and CoreIT devices with various collectors delpoyed to proform the probe for various situations.  The events/alerts triggered by the devices are captured by the SL1 Collector and sent to Europe NetCool Impact System which inturn then creates an Incident(s) in Europe ServiceNow Instance Automation Queue as Auto-Remediation is configured the corretive action is executed using the Ansible Playbooks implemented in the CACF+CACF NEXT Component.

??? info "CACF NEXT"
    Cloud Automation Community Framework NEXT Componet enahances the existing CACF Ansible infrastucture built for AXA organization to leverage capturing of the events/alerts triggered by the MCMS NetCool Impact System by creating an incdent in the Automation Queue so as to initiate the Auto-Remediation correction action by implementing existing plyabooks available in the Community Platform Engineering Catalog or create new Ansible Playbooks for fixing reported incident and then close the incident, on remediation failure the incident is moved from automation queue to the Command Center Queue or created as an Incident(s) in MCMS ServiceNow based on specific configuration setting enabled on the NetCool.
