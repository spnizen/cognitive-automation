## SRE Books Reading Plan

We recommend to read all book chapters, this is the best. However, we don't have time to do the best more often than we like. So, if that's the case, please divide the work and learn from each other.

### Book: Site Reliability Engineering

**First cross-training plan**

1. Everybody needs to read Chapters 1 and 2.
  * Go to this [page](https://pages.github.kyndryl.net/kyndryl-SRE/doc-program-documentation/sre-books-reading-plan/) to see Book links.
2. Then, read the assigned chapters according to the below table.

4. Think about how you can apply this chapter concepts to your own reality: application, customer, team.
  * Add one more paragraph to your summary with how you can apply it to your reality.
5. Present the summarized chapter to the rest of your fellow members within the group.
