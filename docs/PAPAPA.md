[Intro]
Em   Em Am B7 Em
 
[Verse]
Em
Everyday my papa would work 
 
Am
To make ends meet
   B7
To see that we would eat
           Em
Keep those shoes upon my feet
Em
Every night my papa take me
    Am
And tuck me in my bed
B7
Kiss me on my head
      Em
After all the prayers were said
Em
Growing up with him was easy
    Am
Time just flew on by
    B7
The years began to fly
   Em
He aged and so did I
 
[Chorus]
    C       D
And I could tell
     B7                Em
That mama she wasn't well
C             D                 G
Papa knew and deep down so did she
       B7
So did she
C       B7
When she died
B7                     Em
Papa broke down and he cried
C                     Am                 B7
And all he said was, "God, why her? Take me!"
 
[Verse]
Em
Everyday he sat there sleeping
Am
In a walking chair
   B7
He never went upstais
    Em
All because she wasn't there
Em
Then one day my Papa said
          Am
"Son, I'm proud of how you've grown
B7
Make it on your own
        Em
Oh I'll be O.K. alone."
          Em
He said, "There are things you must do."   
Am
Places you must see"                            
    B7
And his eyes were sad                           
           Em
As he said goodbye to me                        
 
[Bridge]
      Em
Every time I kiss my children
Am
Papa's words ring true
      B7
"Your children live through you.
        Em
They'll grow and leave you, too"
           Em
I remember every word
Am
Papa used to say
  B7
I live that every day
   Em
He taught me well that way
      Em
Every night my papa would take me                 
    Am
And tuck me in my bed                           
B7
Kiss me on my head                              
Em
After all my prayers were said                  
      Em
Every night my papa would take me               *
    Am
And tuck me in my bed                           *
B7
Tuck me in my bed                               *
      Em
After all my prayers were said.                 *
