Creating quizzes and technical challenges is an effective way to assess and reinforce Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) skills. Below, I've outlined some sample questions and challenges across various SRE-related skill areas. Feel free to adapt and expand upon them to suit your specific training needs:

1. Reliability Engineering Basics:

Question 1: What are the key principles of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), and how do they differ from traditional operations?
Question 2: Explain the concepts of Service Level Indicators (SLIs), Service Level Objectives (SLOs), and Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Provide an example for each.
Challenge: Given a hypothetical system, create SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs for it based on its critical performance metrics.
2. Incident Management:

Question 1: Describe the steps of the Incident Command System (ICS) and their roles in incident management.
Question 2: What is an Incident Response Playbook, and how does it aid in incident management? Provide an example of a playbook section.
Challenge: Simulate a minor incident, and ask participants to draft an incident report, including a timeline, root cause analysis, and action items.
3. Monitoring and Alerting:

Question 1: Explain the difference between proactive and reactive monitoring. Why is proactive monitoring crucial for SREs?
Question 2: Describe the components of a robust alerting system. What best practices should be followed when setting up alerts?
Challenge: Given a scenario, design a monitoring solution with appropriate alerts for a web application, considering metrics like response time and error rate.
4. Automation and Scripting:

Question 1: What are the benefits of automation in SRE? Provide examples of tasks that can be automated.
Question 2: Write a Python script that automates the deployment of a web application to a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, GCP).
Challenge: Develop a script that performs log analysis and sends alerts for any critical errors in a log file.
5. Load Balancing and Scaling:

Question 1: Explain the concept of load balancing and its role in ensuring high availability and reliability.
Question 2: When should you consider horizontal scaling versus vertical scaling for an application, and why?
Challenge: Design a load balancing strategy for a web service, considering factors like traffic distribution and failover.
6. Disaster Recovery and Redundancy:

Question 1: What are the key components of a disaster recovery plan? How does redundancy play a role in disaster recovery?
Question 2: Describe the differences between active-active and active-passive redundancy configurations. Provide an example for each.
Challenge: Develop a disaster recovery plan for a critical database system, including backup and restoration procedures.
7. Cloud Computing and Containerization:

Question 1: Compare and contrast virtual machines (VMs) and containers. What are the advantages of using containers in SRE?
Question 2: Explain the significance of cloud-native architecture in modern SRE practices.
Challenge: Set up a containerized microservices application on a cloud platform (e.g., Kubernetes on AWS) and ensure its availability and reliability.
These quizzes and challenges can be used as part of your SRE training program to assess participants' knowledge and skills in key areas of Site Reliability Engineering. You can adjust the difficulty level based on the participants' experience and gradually introduce more complex challenges as they progress in their training.
