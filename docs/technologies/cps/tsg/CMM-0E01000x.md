 
### Explanation

The vital product data (VPD) of the specified device is not available. VPD includes information such as the serial number and part number to uniquely identify the device.

CPS System contains two chasis and each Chasis supports 14 nodes. The last letter in the event id 0E01000[x] changes according to the node number. So, the following event ids are for the same issue. But, with the respective compute node. Hence, the solution will be the same.

    0E010001
    0E010002
    0E010003
    0E010004
    0E010005
    0E010006
    0E010007
    0E010008
    0E010009
    0E01000A
    0E01000B
    0E01000C
    0E01000D
    0E01000E

### Severity - 2

### Symptoms

Check for specific event in CPS Events page.

### Solution

1. add a new node to the cloud group
2. migrate VMs off from the node by putting it in maintenance  mode in PAS. 
3. remove the faulty node from the cloud group
4. raise a TS Case with IBM
