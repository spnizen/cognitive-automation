 
### Explanation

CPS System contains two chasis and each Chasis supports 14 nodes. The last letter in the event id 0600A00[x] changes according to the node number. So, the following event ids are for the same issue. But, with the respective compute node. Hence, the solution will be the same.

    0600A001
    0600A002
    0600A003
    0600A004
    0600A005
    0600A006
    0600A007
    0600A008
    0600A009
    0600A00A
    0600A00B
    0600A00C
    0600A00D
    0600A00E

### Symptoms

Check for specific event in CPS Events page.

### Solution

1. reinitialize the node (make sure no VMs running on the node)
2. Still the issue appear the comute node might require to reseat. So, inform SWAT (who are part of BMLS upgrade) 
3. If SWAT is not involed raise a TS case with IBM
4. Logs to be uploaded to TS Case - Most common logs and Compute node logs.
